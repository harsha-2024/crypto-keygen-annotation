# crypto-keygen-annotation
a production-grade Spring Boot (Java 17) project that gives you a robust, large‑scale custom annotation for cryptographically secure random key generation, with AOP enforcement for FIPS-aware algorithms, strong DRBG (SecureRandom), role-based access, rate limiting, auditing, metrics, and correlation IDs.
